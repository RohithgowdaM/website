      Star clusters are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound and
      formed from the same molecular cloud. They are important for studying
      stellar evolution and the formation of galaxies.

      At dhRuVa, we use image processing techniques to analyze images of star
      clusters and identify patterns and anomalies. We are developing machine
      learning algorithms to classify them and detect unusual phenomena in star
      clusters.
