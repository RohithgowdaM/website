      We built a 6 inch Newtonian telescope from scratch, with a maximum
      magnification of 300x. The telescope was built using PVC pipes and a 6
      inch mirror. The telescope has been used to observe the moon and planets.

      Regular sky observation sessions are conducted using the telescope. The
      telescope is also used for astrophotography.
